# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Superhero Bio** is an android app that displays a list of characters in a RecycleView() layout (all universes) from the [SuperHero](https://superheroapi.com/) API.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡ðŸ’¥ðŸ¤›**

## Notes

I got to play with around nested layouts, giving me a deeper understanding on how xml works. Also, I struggled but learned to implement the 'CardView' widgets. It really gives an app a more modern design. Still keeping the superhero theme, though.
